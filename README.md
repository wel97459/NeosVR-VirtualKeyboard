# NeosVR Virtual Keyboard
Virtual Keyboard with the feature of typing on the desktop.

# Features
Sends virtual key presses to any focused windows application.
Added a button to toggle between ingame and desktop typing.

This was made, so that in game while using OVRdrop,
you can type from inside of NeosVR, into any programs like Discord, Chrome, Firefox, ...

Frooxius posted the original keyboard code on the NeosVR Discord,
This is just a modified version of that code.
